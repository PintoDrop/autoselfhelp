## Description

For this project we decided to create an application that allows the user to search for resturants and be able to rate and order food. The user will be able to create a log in that allows them to see from a list of resturants. When the user clicks on a resturant then they are able to see the dishes that are provided from that resturant. The user can also see a star rating given by other users and be able to rate the dishes themselves as well.

## Usage

The user will be able create a login with their email and create a password. The user will also be able to view from a list of resturants and see the dishes that are provided by that business. The user is can see the star ratings for each dish and add to the dishes rating.

## Installation

You will need to install node packages including express-handlebars, express.js, MYSQL2, sequelize, bcrypyt, express-session, and stars-rating.
