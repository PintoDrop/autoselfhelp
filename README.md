## Description

For this project we decided to create an application that allows the user to create a login and then post about issues with their cars. When the user posts about their car issue then they are able to recieve feedback from other users. Once the user has received an answer they are able to rate the response with a star system.

## Usage

The user will be able create a login with their email and create a password. The user will also be able to post about their issues for their car. The user can see other users posts and the responses they received. The user will be able to rate the responses by stars depending on the feedback provided.

## Installation

You will need to install node packages including express-handlebars, express.js, MYSQL2, sequelize, bcrypyt, express-session, and stars-rating.
